  aboutme: `I am an accomplished chemistry graduate with three years of experience working
as a process chemist at Kimia Pars in Tehran, Iran. During my time there, I
worked with an excellent team to run and interpret analytical data for validation
and quality control. Together, we successfully produced a product of exceptional
quality that helped our company win the market. Since moving to the UK two
years ago, I have discovered a passion for technology, particularly in the field of
computer science. As a creative person, I find that software development allows
me to combine my technical skills with my love of problem-solving. I am currently
enrolled in a highly collaborative, intensive 9-month 20hr/week software
development course with Code Your Future (CYF), where I am learning new
skills and gaining experience in web development.`,
